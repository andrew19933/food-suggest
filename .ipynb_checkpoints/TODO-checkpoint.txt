TODO:
- parse ingredients list so that it can reckognize volumetric/weight terms (eg. tsp, Tbsp, cup, grams) and structure ingredients list in (ingredient, amount) normalized to, say, grams or something


really should use vocab as an ingredient dictionary, this makes a lot more sense when padding

figure out how <code>embedding_dim</code> should compare to <code>vocab_size</code>

look up why using *sparse* categorical crossentropy


should check the entries where accented symbols, etc. occur to inspect the data

do we really need padding? feel like we don't

might want to split based on '\n' so that dictionary consists of all possible ingredients (hopefully unique-ish). even better would be to use a dictionary of ingredients. might also want to 'generate' new data by shuffling the order of ingredients within recipes, since the order doesn't seem like a useful thing to remember
