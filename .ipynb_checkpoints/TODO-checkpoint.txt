TODO:

- perhaps get rid of unnecessary stuff in symbol_blacklist
- improve symbol_blacklist so that best_ids_from_ingred_list is faster
- optimize application of best_ids_from_ingred_list to list, takes about 130 seconds for 10000 entries
- figure out how <code>embedding_dim</code> should compare to <code>vocab_size</code>
- get better vocab list
- see what percent of ingredient phrases don't match anything

- look up why using *sparse* categorical crossentropy

- might want to 'generate' new data by shuffling the order of ingredients within recipes, since the order doesn't seem like a useful thing to remember
