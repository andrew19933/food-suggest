TODO:

- perhaps get rid of unnecessary stuff in symbol_blacklist
- make best_id_from_ingred word on newline-delimited list
- optimize best_id_from_ingred for finding longest substring match (perhaps start with longest substrings and only proceed if no matches?)



- parse ingredients list so that it can reckognize volumetric/weight terms (eg. tsp, Tbsp, cup, grams) and structure ingredients list in (ingredient, amount) normalized to, say, grams or something

figure out how <code>embedding_dim</code> should compare to <code>vocab_size</code>

look up why using *sparse* categorical crossentropy

might want to split based on '\n' so that dictionary consists of all possible ingredients (hopefully unique-ish). even better would be to use a dictionary of ingredients. might also want to 'generate' new data by shuffling the order of ingredients within recipes, since the order doesn't seem like a useful thing to remember
